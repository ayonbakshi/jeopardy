Jeopardy is a quiz-show style game with three contestants. The game
board consists of a grid of questions with 6 topics and 5 questions
per topic with values $200, $400, $600, $800, $1000. Players choose a
question, then are presented with the answer and must select the
correct question that goes with the answer. If the player guesses
correctly, they are awarded the value of the question. If the player
guesses incorrectly, the next player gets a chance to guess. If no
player guesses correctly, they are shown the answer and nobody gets
money. After a question has been played, it is disabled. The last
correct answerer chooses the next question.

One question in the game is a daily double. The player who selects the
daily double can wager any amount of money up to their current balance
or $1000, whichever is larger. Only the player who selects the daily
double gets to guess. If the player is correct, they gain the amount
they wagered. If they are incorrect, they lose that amount.

The game ends when all the questions have been played. The player with
the largest amount of money at the end of the game wins.
